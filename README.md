# StudentHub

## Calum, Rachael, Zain & Zerh

## Purpose of the App

StudentHub is our LAP 4 Group Project. It is a social media platform for university students where they can connect with other students and make posts in specified categories to ask for help, post tips/information, or otherwise.

Users can:

- register an account and log in
- access their own profile page
- search for a user to view their profile page
- follow other users to see their posts
- view all the posts from the users they follow
- view category pages to see all posts in that category
- make a new post, and add category tags to it

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JS
- Front-end client:
  - NodeJS
  - React
- Back-end api:
  - Python
  - Django - Django Rest Framework
  - PostgreSQL database

The [client](https://student-hubs.netlify.app/) is deployed on Netlify, and the [API](https://studenthub-api.herokuapp.com/) is hosted on Heroku. A description of the available API routes is provided in the [API_ROUTES](backend/API_ROUTES.md) file.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

- Clone or download the repo
- Client:
  - cd into the `Frontend/` folder and run `npm install` to install packages
- Backend:
  - cd into the `backend/` folder and run `pipenv install -r requirements.txt` to install packages
  - Alternatively install with the provided `requirements.txt` file with your package manager of choice

### Usage

- Client (within the `Frontend/` folder):
  - `npm run dev` creates a dev build and serves it on localhost port 8080
  - `npm run build` creates a production build in the `build/` folder
- Backend (within the `backend/` folder):
  - `pipenv shell` enters the virtual environment
  - `pipenv run dev` (or `python manage.py runserver` within the virtual environment) runs the dev server on localhost port 8000
  - `pipenv run test` starts the test suite
  - `pipenv run coverage` generates a test coverage report
  - `pipenv run coverage_report` views the coverage report generated by `pipenv run coverage`

## Wins

- Strong team communication & collaboration
- Achieved full back-end functionality with authorisations and custom permissions
- A minimalistic and clear app design
- Implementation of a custom 404 page on the client site
- Successfully deployed both front and back ends despite challenges

## Challenges

- The number of API routes and what they did was confusing when connecting up front and back ends
  - This led to the creation of the API_ROUTES document
- Github commits just disappeared at one point, had to make new branches and be careful with future commits
- Had issues getting the backend deploy fully running, was fixed once we realised how to run the migrations on the heroku app
- Had issues with routing/refreshing pages on the frontend deploy, however have managed to resolve these

## Bugs

- [] News api being used only allows localhost, would need to find a more suitable api for the news page
- [] The user registration system successfully creates a user that can log in, however breaks when trying to subsequently generate a token, token generation on login works fine however

## Future Features

- Implementation in front-end of the functionality existant in the api
  - Commenting on posts
  - Post reactions
  - Editing/deleting posts
  - Editing user profile
- Live chat functionality
- Mobile responsiveness
- Front-end testing
